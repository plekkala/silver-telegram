Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building web applications and microservices with Java. This guide provides a detailed plan to gain hands-on experience and learn Spring Boot and Spring Services effectively.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java programming
- Familiarity with web development concepts
- Understanding of RESTful APIs

## Learning Plan

### Week 1: Introduction to Spring Boot
1. **Setup Development Environment**
    - Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
    - Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
    - Install Maven or Gradle for dependency management

2. **Learn the Basics**
    - Understand the Spring Framework and its core concepts
    - Explore the Spring Boot project structure
    - Create a simple Spring Boot application

3. **Hands-On Practice**

### Week 2: Building RESTful Services
1. **Understanding RESTful Services**
    - Learn about REST architecture and principles
    - Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

2. **Creating RESTful APIs with Spring Boot**
    - Create REST controllers using `@RestController`
    - Define request mappings with `@RequestMapping` and `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
    - Handle request parameters and path variables

3. **Hands-On Practice**
    - Build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a simple entity (e.g., Product)
    - Test the API using Postman or similar tools

### Week 3: Data Access with Spring Data JPA

    - Understand the basics of JPA (Java Persistence API)
    - Learn about Spring Data JPA and its advantages

2. **Integrating Spring Data JPA**
    - Configure a database connection (H2, MySQL, etc.)
    - Create JPA entities and repositories
    - Perform CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA

3. **Hands-On Practice**
    - Build a Spring Boot application with a database backend
    - Implement repository interfaces and custom queries

### Week 4: Advanced Topics and Best Practices
1. **Spring Boot Security**
    - Learn about Spring Security basics
    - Implement authentication and authorization

2. **Exception Handling**
    - Implement global exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice`
    - Customize error responses

3. **Testing Spring Boot Applications**
    - Write unit tests for controllers and services
    - Use Spring Boot Test for integration testing

4. **Hands-On Practice**
    - Secure your RESTful API with Spring Security
    - Write comprehensive tests for your application
