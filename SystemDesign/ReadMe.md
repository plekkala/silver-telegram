## Introduction
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a critical skill for software engineers, especially those working on large-scale applications.

## Key Concepts
### Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load without compromising performance. It can be achieved through vertical scaling (adding more power to existing machines) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).

### Reliability
Reliability refers to the ability of a system to function correctly and consistently over time. It involves designing systems that can recover from failures and continue to operate.

### Availability
Availability is the measure of a system's uptime. It is often expressed as a percentage of time the system is operational and accessible.

### Performance
Performance is the measure of how quickly a system responds to requests. It involves optimizing response times and throughput.

## Design Principles
### Single Responsibility Principle
Each component or module should have a single responsibility and should encapsulate that responsibility entirely.

### Loose Coupling
Components should be designed to minimize dependencies on each other, allowing them to be modified independently.

### High Cohesion
Components that are related in functionality should be grouped together, promoting better organization and maintainability.

### Fault Tolerance
Design systems to handle and recover from failures gracefully, ensuring minimal impact on users.

## Common Design Patterns
### Load Balancing
Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.

### Caching
Storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area to reduce latency and improve performance.

### Sharding
Splitting a database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards to improve performance and scalability.

### Microservices
Breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
